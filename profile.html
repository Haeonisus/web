					<h2>Who I Am</h2>
					<p>
						Hi, I'm Haewon Park, and I'm from South Korea.</br>

						I'm pursuing Bachelor of Science in Information and entrepreneurship minor at University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.
						My concentration for Information major is User Experience Design (UXD). During my high school years, I took computer science, which covers web designing and other basic principles of coding, and Application Design, which made me think about majoring in Computer Science. However, I realized that School of Information is more related to the web/app development and product design with the Human-Centered Design. So, I changed my mind to take information degree.</br>
						I want to create accessible products, websites, applications, etc., to solve the problems of exclusion which are causing by the development of technologies.
