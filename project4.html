			<h2> Elevator Pitch </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Our social media app is designed for music enthusiasts who love sharing their favorite songs and music clips with friends and the public. Our platform provides users with various features, including the ability to edit their music using tools such as music cut and mosaic. When we design our app, we use Amy Jo Kim’s Nine Timeless Principles for Building Community [1] as a reference. We offer two versions of the app: a free version that allows users to create 15-second music clips and a subscription-based version that provides access to the full range of features, including the ability to curate playlists. Users can use the app's essential functions for free, but they must subscribe to interact with others and join groups. Our target audience is the general public, and we welcome everyone to our community, including those with disabilities.</br>
					Additionally, special features will be offered to verified artists to encourage community growth. To ensure that everyone can use our app, we provide a range of accessibility features, such as music sound wave visualization, which is particularly useful for those with hearing impairments or those in noisy environments. Our app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for everyone to create and share music clips. We believe that music is a powerful medium for self-expression and connection, and we are committed to building a safe and welcoming space for music lovers to share their passion with others.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2> Design </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Our proposed community is an application meant for music sharing and playlist creation. Its main features would include the ability to send / share song clips while adding your commentary (something like ‘this made me think of you’ or ‘on repeat rn’) while also connecting users based on their music tastes. This way, the app would act as a networked public, where users can construct a virtual space for in-person interactions and relationships [2]. Unlike other applications, we would have default privacy to users’ accounts, where they would have to send their links to friends for them to see their accounts. We include this feature to protect the user’s privacy while diminishing the potential of context collapse, as users will feel more open to genuine interactions with a smaller audience [3]. This however could be changed in the settings if a user wanted to make their account visible to strangers through the Explore page. Users could also change their settings of the default ‘family friendly’ version, where they would have access to explicit content after inputting their date of birth.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the primary ways we would attract new members would be through partnerships with artists, where they would use the app to share their playlists and tease new music to their fans. Artists also encourage participation by offering giveaways or special perks to their followers. Except for music knocking and adding commentary, this would be very similar to a Spotify profile, so new users wouldn’t need to spend much time or energy learning how to use the application, minimizing some of the challenges of being a newcomer [4]. We would retain members by offering them something that other applications do not; that is, the ability to connect with their friends based on music preferences, discover new songs or artists, and see a more personal side of some of their favorite artists while also being some of the first to hear their new music [5]. The emphasis on tight communities and close connections would create a solid bond-based community between listeners and artists [6].
				</p>
				<p>
					We would also offer a subscription model, where users could make collaborative playlists with their friends and listen to full songs directly from the app (as opposed to just snippets of music). While a paid subscription would offer more affordances to the user, there wouldn’t be any differences in the types of participation users will contribute, as anyone can post their favorite songs and follow friends / favorite artists. There would be a difference between the average user and music creators (who would be verified), though, as the verified accounts would be able to upload new music instead of only posting pre-existing songs. Limiting the amount of user-generated content to only verified accounts would also limit the opportunities for bad behavior [7]. Verified accounts would also have the chance to view their analytics and would have more affordances in their public posts (such as adding links, creating polls, etc.).
				</p>
				<p>
					Since most users would be limited to only posting songs on a linked platform (such as Apple Music, Spotify, etc.), there would be some regulation on what is appropriate on the app. However, if someone uses the right song to make an inappropriate statement, automated bots would flag harmful words/phrases as potential hate speech and warn users if their posts could be misconstrued. The app would also repeatedly remind users about the prevailing norms of the community to limit harassment or trolling [8]. Additionally, users could report posts they find offensive directly from the post. To gauge the success of our community, we would look at the total number of music streams/posts rather than the number of accounts, as one user might have multiple accounts to accommodate a diverse music taste.
				</p>
				<p>
					Following Amy Jo Kim’s Nine Principles of Design, we would expand this community into the real world. Our music platform would host regular music-related events to promote engagement among members of our community. These events may include music-sharing meetings with famous musicians as prizes, and prizes are distributed based on participation. Overall, SoundShare offers a high degree of freedom for creating music playlists, and we support cooperation between friends or people with similar musical tastes. And as users use the app, the algorithm learns their tastes and suggests new music or users that match their preferences. Through its very intentional design, our platform would provide a collaborative and engaging space for music lovers to connect and create meaningful experiences.

			<h2> Mockups </h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Home and Explore Page</h3>
				<p>
					The home page allows users to add posts to share songs. Their posts and other users’ posts can also be reviewed. Users can create new playlists and check playlists and songs they liked and recently played. Users also can check recently shared songs. In addition, the search bar brings users to the Explore page to search for specific songs, playlists, or artists. 
                    </br>The explore page allows users to search songs by genre, popular playlists, and the most shared songs. These types of searches help them find music based on their tastes and current trends in the music community. As the user uses the app, this page becomes more specialized as it learns the user’s music taste. </br>
					<img src="images/homeexplore.jpg" alt="home and explore page">
				</p>
				<h3>Profile Page and Verified Profiles</h3>
				<p>
					This figure represents the specific page that a user would have. The profile page includes followers, following, posts, playlists, and a bio. The bio is changeable through the account button at the bottom of the profile page. There is also a spot for playlists and posts displaying the most popular or recent of both categories. If another user were viewing this profile, everything would be the same despite the settings options at the bottom of the page. </br>
                    Verified profiles are similar to a standard profile but with the ability to see analytics and insights of the profile. This includes seeing the number of followers for each playlist, the business analytics of sponsored posts, and the trends of following / engagement for the profile. Most importantly, these profiles would have the option to add new music clips to the site (the big plus sign), which is where they could ‘leak’ new music to their fans. </br>
					<img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="profiles">
				</p>
				<h3>DMs</h3>
				<p>
					DMs are where users can share music, advice, tracks, and playlists with other application users. Since our application creates a bond-based community, these personalized messages would be essential for relationship formation and maintenance [9]. There are no limits to who can message who, nor are there limits on receiving messages. If you are uncomfortable with the user messaging you, you can choose not to respond or block the user. The screen shows an interaction between a popular verified user and a less famous artist. The less popular user is asking for advice for her new song recently released on the application. This demonstrates how interactions within this online community can incredibly benefit musical welfare.
					<img src="images/dms.jpg" alt="DMs" class="one">
				</p>
				<h3>Public Post</h3>
				<p>
					Public posts take one of two forms: uploading the album cover or specific lyrics. Like Instagram, users would choose which part of the song they’d like to post and then edit the audio clip to include it. Users can also add their commentary to the post and tag users or artists in this caption using the @ feature. Music would have to be available on the site through a third-party connection (such as Spotify, Apple Music, etc.) or uploaded directly by a verified user.
					<img src="images/publicpost.jpg" alt="Public Post" class="one">
				</p>
				<h3>Privacy / Settings</h3>
				<p>
					Lee Higgings mentioned in his article that creating a welcoming “safety within safety” environment is essential [10]. This page is designed to give users control over the privacy and customization options. Users can choose to make their accounts public or private. With a personal account, only invited friends can see the homepage and playlists. In addition, there are other settings users can adjust, such as preferences related to camera and microphone usage, music visualization, and more extensive text options for users who may require it. Our platform prioritizes user privacy and safety, as usually, the most vulnerable users are those harmed by default publicness [11].
					<img src="images/privacyseeting.jpg" alt="Privacy and Setting" class="one">
				</p>
				<h3>Collaborative Playlist
				</h3>
				<p>
					This page is designed to provide a space for users to create a music playlist with their friends and express their feelings through music. Each playlist has a manager, with the user who creates the playlist being the default manager, which provides a range of roles for the community. Once the manager grants permission, any user who has joined the playlist can modify it by adding or removing songs, changing the order of songs, and making any other authorized modifications. We hope this feature will allow users to collaborate with their friends and create playlists reflecting their shared interests and emotions.

			<h2> User Scenarios </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Ben is an avid social media user and has amassed a few thousand followers on numerous platforms by posting lifestyle content. One of the things he frequently shares on his Instagram stories is some of his favorite songs using the app's features. From doing this, he has gained a following of users that precisely follow him for his music taste. These followers specifically want to see when he posts new or ‘undiscovered’ songs/artists and aren’t as interested in the rest of his content. He has a story highlight reel linked to his profile that contains all of these posts. However, since it’s hard to determine when a user posts a song to their story on social media rather than a regular base, some users unfollow him due to this frustration. Realizing this, Ben looks to link his music taste to a specific site but is disappointed with the lack of personality that can be incorporated into a Spotify playlist. Therefore, he turns to our community to share his music with a more general audience while incorporating his style and personality. </br>

					Jenna is a college student who loves music and recommends it to others. She will share a specific song with her friends if she loves a particular piece. Various apps make features to share music, but their primary purpose is for something other than music, which makes her find another app. She found an app that only allows sharing information about music and part of a song to give a taste of recommendation. However, she wants to keep her suggestion private from unknown users on the app because some might not agree with her. So, she uses a function to share her music only with the people she chooses and chat privately. When she clicks a button to share the music, a pop-up screen asks her to post it publicly or send it to a particular person or group.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					SoundShare allows users to post short clips and moments from music, contribute to playlists, and subscribe to complete songs. Entering the music community, many platforms have similar features. One application that has a similar idea is MuzApp. MuzApp is an application that allows users to listen to music ad-free while maintaining social interaction through posting tracks and pinning moods to their profile. Unfortunately, this application is no longer available to download to any device. While the reasoning for its disappearance is unclear, SoundShare will draw from the well-designed features of this platform while mixing others.
					</br>
					MuzApp was similar to Spotify; however, it has more of the features of a social platform. SoundShare would be different because we allow users to post music and contribute to public playlists. Similarly to Spotify and Apple Music, subscriptions are required to eliminate ads and have a seamless user experience. Spotify has a similar feature where users can add friends to make a contributive playlist. Users being able to post original music clips also ties back to Tik Tok and Instagram, where there are endless short videos with unique sounds. Users can publish their unique sounds; others engage with them when they see their videos. SoundShare varies here because users can listen to the whole song rather than just a snippet. With the subscription, there is no need to go hunting for a song you heard because it will be available on the app. Soundcloud is another similar musical application. Soundcloud differs from Spotify and Apple Music because smaller artists can post music. Users can then stop and drop comments and save the songs to their playlists or follow artists. However, it needs to have the social aspect of contributing to playlists or personally interacting with other artists. Our online community will tie together the creative elements with social contributions.
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2> Ethical Reflections </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					When it comes to ethics, most applications have a skewed viewpoint. For example, companies such as Tik Tok operate because the application is addictive, so we are not willing to give it up despite them taking much of our data as a foreign entity. It is also important to note that studying ethics raises ethical questions. “Is it ethically right to study chat room participants without their consent? Is it right to annoy/ disturb significant numbers of participants in order to obtain consent from a few?” asks Bruckman and Hudson (Bruckman). Due to the very study determining ethical questionability being potentially unethical, our goal with creating SoundShare is to avoid ethical concerns altogether. When using the app, in the settings feature, there is an option to make your account private, ask the app not to track data, and have the opportunity to change that quickly, access your location, and access your camera and microphone. With these in mind, our application will exceed the ethics of most other applications. By giving consumers full access to controlling their privacy, our application will remain ethical, and we will also be open to hearing feedback. Lastly, we are implementing features for the visually or audibly disabled. This will allow people passionate about music to participate in this community despite any difficulties.
